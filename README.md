The design is compact and visually appeling, the cooking abilities are on par with most other sous vide cookers, but the main selling point of the Joule is the features that are included with the app.

### Ease of Use
To make the Joule seem more user friendly, the user controls the cooking device completely through the app. Though requiring the user to download an app to use their device isn't necessarily user friendly, it definitely makes the device seem more modern and trendy which helps their marketing.

After connecting your cooking device to your phone's bluetooth and home's wifi, you are able to control and monitor cooking from anywhere with internet access. This is very useful for people who work during the day because it allows them to cook meals that would normally take all day. Just start heat the water and add the food and it will slow cook food up to 48 hours.

The Joule's companion app also comes in handy when cooking by not only supplying recipies, but also giving a visual guide on how long to cook a cut of meat. Overall the features of an internet connected devices outweigh the drawbacks.

### Marketing
There are many other Sous Vide products on the market and the Chef Steps Joule is the most expensive. Still, none of the others are anywhere near as popular as the Joule, and I think this is due to their marketing.

Chef Steps' advertising was effective enough to explain all of the features listed above in its photo ads. Not only were the features and online capabilities very clear, but they made the produce seem high end and fashionable, kind of like a status symbol. Those things combined with a simple, user friendly website seem to be enough to win people over. 

### Why it Matters
Though Chef Steps is not a charitable company, we can look at their business model and see houw it could be turned into something that helps the world. Any simple, useful, and well designed product can be marketed in a similar way, and ideally a portion of the proceeds could be used charitibly.
