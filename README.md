### Ease of Use
To make the Joule seem more user friendly, the user controls the cooking device completely through the app. Though requiring the user to download an app to use their device isn't necessarily user friendly, it definitely makes the device seem more modern and trendy which helps their marketing.
After connecting your cooking device to your phone's bluetooth and home's wifi, you are able to control and monitor cooking from anywhere with internet access. This is very useful for people who work during the day because it allows them to cook meals that would normally take all day. Just start heat the water and add the food and it will slow cook food up to 48 hours.
The Joule's companion app also comes in handy when cooking by not only supplying recipies, but also giving a visual guide on how long to cook a cut of meat. Overall the features of an internet connected devices outweigh the drawbacks.
